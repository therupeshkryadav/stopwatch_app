# ⏱️ Flutter Stopwatch App – MVC Architecture

A clean and testable **Flutter Stopwatch application** built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. This project demonstrates separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability using `provider` for state management. Ideal for learning how to scale small to medium-sized apps with clean code practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

lib/
├── controllers/        # Business logic (Controller layer)
│   └── stopwatch_controller.dart
├── models/             # Data representation (Model layer)
│   └── stopwatch_model.dart
├── views/              # UI screens (View layer)
│   └── stopwatch_screen.dart
├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
│   └── control_buttons.dart
└── main.dart           # App entry point


✅ This follows a **layer-based MVC** structure, which is ideal for smaller apps, helping you clearly separate business logic, data models, and UI components.

---

## 🧠 Architecture: MVC Pattern

- **Model**: Represents app state and core data (`StopwatchModel`)
- **View**: Renders UI, listens to state changes (`StopwatchScreen`, `ControlButtons`)
- **Controller**: Manages state and business logic (`StopwatchController`)
- **State Management**: Achieved using `provider` and `ChangeNotifier`

---

## 🛠 Features

- ⏱ Start, Pause, and Reset stopwatch
- 🧠 Strict MVC structure
- 🧩 State managed with `provider`
- 🧪 Unit tests for controller logic
- 🗂 Scalable folder structure
- ✨ Beginner-friendly and extendable
